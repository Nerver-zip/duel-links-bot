## ⚙️ Initial Setup

1. **Select the resolution** your game is running at in the **Options** menu.  
   Supported resolutions:
   - 1280x720  
   - 1600x900  
   - 1920x1080
   **I recommend using low resolutions and windowed mode.**  
   Also make sure the **entire game screen is fully visible on your monitor**.  
   If anything is cropped or hidden behind the taskbar, the bot might fail.

2. **Set your screen zoom level**, if you're using Windows scaling (e.g., 125%, 150%).  
   Example: If you're on 125%, enter `1.25` in the zoom field.

3. **Gate Duel (SPEED or RUSH) mode requires a monster-only deck.**  
   The bot does **not** currently support spells or traps.
